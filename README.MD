SnapCare is a an application that allows uses to users to take pictures of visible skin conditions and get feedback on what is the most probable diagnoses, and what to after. This application uses a fine tuned CNN Resnet model from pytorch's torchvision.models in order to train a dataset of pictures of skin diseases taken by camera with 114 different classes We combined a dataset (SD-198) with a web-scraped to make a dataset with over 17.5k thousand images with 114 classes. We use Gemini API to use to the results given by the model in order to give feedback to the user on next steps to approach on how to handle the disease. For the frontend we used react-native, typescript, and java script, for the backend, we used django. This application is still a protype, and medical advice given by the model should be taken with a grain of salt and be approached appropiately. Thank you, and enjoy using the app!
